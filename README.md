# stock-analysis

## Purpose
To allow Steve look at many tickers throught 2017 and 2018 to better advise his parents. In order to complete this quicker we were required to refactor the code. This will allow Steve to give the best advise to his parents as quick as possible.

## Results
After running the Macro for 2017 and 2018, I would suggest that Steve's parents invest in ENPH and RUN. These stocks have consistently been in the green for 2017 and 2018. Steve will need to add more recent data to his data and run the macro to advise more current return.
